 *
 * Everything needed to get an IRC connection going and do simple IRC operations
 * is provided by this header.
 *
 * Usage example for a simple ECHO-like IRC bot (receives messages and sends
 * them back to the channel it saw them on):
 * \code
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <stdlib.h>
 * #include <string.h>
 *
 * #include <libsrsirc/irc.h>
 *
 * #define SERVER "irc.example.org"
 * #define PORT 6667
 * #define CHANNEL "#mychannel"
 * #define NICKNAME "mynickname"
 *
 * int main(void) {
 *     irc *ictx = irc_init();
 *
 *     irc_set_server(ictx, SERVER, PORT);
 *     irc_set_nick(ictx, NICKNAME);
 *
 *     if (!irc_connect(ictx)) {
 *         fprintf(stderr, "irc_connect() failed\n");
 *         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 *     }
 *
 *     irc_printf(ictx, "JOIN %s", CHANNEL);
 *
 *     while (irc_online(ictx)) {
 *         tokarr msg;
 *         int r = irc_read(ictx, &msg, 1000000); // 1 second timeout
 *
 *         if (r == 0)
 *             continue; // Timeout, nothing was read yet.
 *
 *         if (r == -1) {
 *             fprintf(stderr, "irc_read() failed\n");
 *             break; // We're offline, irc_read() calls irc_reset() on error.
 *         }
 *
 *         // If we have reached this point, r must be 1, which means a message
 *         // was read.  Let's see what it is.  We care about PRIVMSG to
 *         // implement our ECHO behavior, and about PING to avoid timing out.
 *
 *         if (strcmp(msg[1], "PING") == 0)         // msg[1] is always the cmd
 *             irc_printf(ictx, "PONG %s", msg[2]); // msg[2] is the first arg
 *         else if (strcmp(msg[1], "PRIVMSG") == 0 && msg[2][0] == '#') // (*)
 *             irc_printf(ictx, "PRIVMSG %s :%s", msg[2], msg[3]);
 *
 *         // (*) Note that the line marked with (*) is NOT the right way to
 *         //     check whether the target is a channel (as opposed to a
 *         //     nickname - ours - in which case this would be a PM.
 *         //     However, it should suffice for the purposes of this example.
 *         //     The correct way would be to use irc_005chanmodes() to figure
 *         //     out whether tok[2][0] is a known channel type.
 *     }
 *
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Our connection is rekt.\n");
 *
 *     irc_dispose(ictx);
 *
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * Assuming that code is saved as ircecho.c and libsrsirc was installed under
 * the /usr/local prefix (`./configure --prefix=/usr/local`), you'd build it
 * as follows:
 * \code
 * cc -I /usr/local/include -L /usr/local/lib -o ircecho ircecho.c -lsrsirc
 * \endcode
 * And run as:
 * \code
 * ./ircecho
 * \endcode
 * If that doesn't seem to work, run it with debugging messages as follows:
 * \code
 * export LIBSRSIRC_DEBUG=7       # 7 enables loglevels up to DEBUG.
 * export LIBSRSIRC_DEBUG_FANCY=1 # Only if your terminal supports ANSI colors
 * ./ircecho # Should now spit out information about what went wrong.
 *           # Forgot to change those #define-s, eh, master paster? :-)
 * \endcode
 * Have fun!

/** \brief Allocate and initialize a new IRC context.
 *
 * This is the function you will typically use before calling any other
 * libsrsirc function.  It allocates and initializes a new IRC context that is
 * used internally to hold all the state associated with this IRC connection,
 * as well as to distinguish it from other, unrelated IRC connections made
 * using libsrsirc.
 *
 * An opaque pointer (i.e. a handle) to the new IRC context is returned to the
 * user and will remain valid until irc_dispose() is called for that pointer.
 * The user will generally need to supply this pointer as the first argument
 * to most libsrsirc functions, but will never dereference it themselves.
 * (This is analoguous to how FILE * works in standard C.)
 *
 * This function can be called an arbitrary number of times, if there is a need
 * for many independent IRC connections using libsrsirc.  However, most programs
 * will probably need only one IRC connection and therefore call this function
 * only once.
 *
 * If the IRC context is no longer required, call irc_dispose() on it to
 * release the associated state and resources.
 *
 * \return A pointer to the new IRC context, or NULL if we are out of memory. \n

 * (until one works for us).
 *
 * Behavior is affected by two timeouts (a "hard" and a "soft" timeout)
 * The "hard" timeout limits the overall time we try to get an IRC connection
