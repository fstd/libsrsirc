/** \brief Logon-time callback for incoming protocol messages

 * of sending PASS/NICK/USER, potentially responding to a PING, handling a
 * number of exceptional situations (e.g. nickname already in use) and finally
 * waiting for the (required) messages 001-004, after which we consider
 * ourselves logged on.
 *
 * Thus, the first message that the user can actually irc_read() will be
 * whatever the IRC server sends after its 004.
 *
 * To access the messages that come before 004, a callback function can be
 * provided; whenever libsrsirc receives a logon-time message from the server,
 * it will callback to inform the user and let them decide whether to continue
 * or abort the logon.  This is the type of such a callback.
 *
 * \param   msg Pointer to a tokarr that contains the message we read
 * \param   tag An arbitrary "user data" pointer that can be provided when
 *            registering the callback (see irc_regcb_conread()).
 *
 * \return If the callback returns false, the attempt to logon is aborted.

 * desired nickname isn't available.

 * \param   nick   Buffer that contains the nickname that was not available.
 *                 The callback function's job is to modify the nickname stored
 *                 in this buffer, which will then be tried as an alternative
 * \param   nick_sz   Size of the buffer pointed to by `nick`.

/** \brief User-registered protocol command callback type
 *
 * As an alternative to interpreting messages right after irc_read(), the user
 * can register callback functions that are automatically invoked for matching
 * incoming protocol messages.  This is the type of such callbacks.
 *
 * \param ctx   The IRC context of the instance that read the protocol message
 * \param msg   Pointer to a tokarr that contains the message that was read
 * \param nargs    Number of non-NULL elements in `*msg`
 * \param pre   True if this callback was invoked BEFORE any changes to the
 *              internal library state that result from interpreting the
 *              message, false if it was invoked AFTERwards (message handlers
 *              can be registered both ways).  For example, if we have
 *              registered a PRE-NICK handler and change our nickname, then
 *              inside the handler, irc_mynick() will give us our old nickname.
 *              If it was a POST-NICK handler, we'd instead see our new nick.
 *              For most message types, PRE and POST handlers are equivalent
 *              because libsrsirc doesn't need to do anything with most
 *              messages.
 * \return   If the callback returns `false`, the connection is reset.
